    This middleware intercepts incoming requests and validates the API key

    secure way to protect API endpoints.

    Authentication is skipped for OPTIONS requests and for a predefined set of
    exempt paths, such as health checks and documentation. If no API key is
    configured in the application settings, this middleware becomes a no-op,
    allowing all requests to pass through, which is useful for local development.
