Request schemas for API endpoints.

STRUCTURAL validation only (format, type, basic constraints). Business logic
validation (e.g., max_text_length from settings) is handled in the service layer

    This model accepts multiple texts for batch processing with configurable

    volumes of text asynchronously.

    Attributes:

        max_batch_size: Maximum batch size for processing optimization (optional).
