"""
Dependency injection for the MLOps sentiment analysis service.

This module provides centralized dependency injection functions for FastAPI,
following the dependency inversion principle. It allows for a clean separation
of concerns and makes the application more modular, testable, and maintainable
by decoupling the API layer from the concrete implementations of services and
models.

All dependency injection functions now return interface types rather than
concrete implementations, enabling loose coupling and easier testing.
