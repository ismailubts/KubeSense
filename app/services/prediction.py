"""
Prediction service for the MLOps sentiment analysis service.

This module encapsulates the business logic for making predictions, acting as
an intermediary between the API layer and the underlying machine learning
model. It ensures that concerns are properly separated and provides a clean
interface for the rest of the application to interact with the model.
