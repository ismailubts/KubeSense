# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the KubeSentiment project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: Short description of the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
4. **Decision**: The change we're proposing or have agreed to
5. **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do

## Creating New ADRs

When creating a new ADR:

1. Create a new file named `NNN-title-with-dashes.md`
2. Use the next available number (NNN - next is 012)
3. Follow the [ADR template](TEMPLATE.md)
4. Update this index
5. Add to the appropriate category above

### Using the Template

A comprehensive ADR template is available at [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md). The template includes:

- Standard ADR structure (Context, Decision, Consequences)
- Sections for alternatives considered
- Implementation details and code examples
- Performance metrics and validation
- Operational considerations
- Related ADRs and references

### Quick Template

For a minimal ADR, use this structure:

```markdown
# ADR NNN: [Title]

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Authors:** [Names]
**Supersedes:** [ADR number if applicable]

## Context

[Describe the issue or challenge that requires a decision]

## Decision

[Describe the decision that was made]

## Consequences

### Positive

- [List positive outcomes]

### Negative

- [List negative outcomes or trade-offs]

### Neutral

- [List neutral impacts]

## Alternatives Considered

- **Alternative 1:** [Description and why it was rejected]
- **Alternative 2:** [Description and why it was rejected]

## References

- [Links to relevant documentation, RFCs, discussions, etc.]
```
